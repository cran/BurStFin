Changes in version 1.01 (2012-02-12):

NEW FEATURES

    o The 'threeDarr' function is added.  This creates three-dimensional
      arrays out of matrices.

CHANGES

    o 'var.shrink.eqcor' and 'factor.model.stat' have a new argument
      'verbose' that controls whether some warnings are given.  Both
      functions can warn if there are no negative values in the input
      'x' -- an indication in finance that prices rather than returns
      are given.  Warnings in 'factor.model.stat' about constant
      columns in 'x' and negative specific variances are also controlled.

    o 'var.add.benchmark' has a new argument 'sum.to.one' that allows
      a "benchmark" to have weights that sum to something other than
      one.  An example is to give portfolio weights minus benchmark
      weights.

BUG FIXES

    o (none)
